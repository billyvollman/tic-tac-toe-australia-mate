# tic-tac-toe-australia-mate

G'day Y'all,

I'm Billy Vollman and a current student at General Assmebly in Melbourne, enrolled in the Software Engineering Immersive course.  This is our first class project to create a Tic Tac Toe game which allows two players to play tic tac toe.

link to game is here [Tic Tac Toe Australia Mate] (../billyvollman/Documents/sei/projects/tic_tac_toe_game/index.html)

I've taken an Aussie stance on game and have made the Xs & Os, either Kangaroos or Koalas.  To have the game appear more dynamic, I've used animated gifs for the pieces.

### Current challenges I'm having are

**1. Making the Javascript code condensed.**
  - My current logic for tracking players is via a series of IF and ELSE IF statements. There has to be better way, but I'm not sure where to begin and open to ideas and feedback.
  - I'm afraid to add more features to game as the code would blow out more, so rather than add more things to keep track of, it might be good to stop and think the logic through some more
  
**2. Responsiveness not the best**
  - I would like the game to be sizeable and playable regardless of device it is played on.  I made things in flex boxes but am struggling with knowing how to make this work better.  I have found vh and vw which helped some but there must be an easier way.
 
**3. To start game I would like the players to choose their side.  Either Kangaroo or Koala.**
 
**4. At end of game I would like an image to appear based on who won.**  
- If Koala, show an aniamted gif for Koala, if Kangaroo show Kangaroo, if tie show both animals.
 
**5. Allow players to add their own names, rather than Player 1 or Player 2**
 
**6. Add a reset function to reset the scores.**
  - Currently you have to refresh the page.
 
**7. Allow game to let players switch.**
 
**8. Keep track of how individual player has gone against another player over time.**
  - Imagine this is a game you have been playing against someone else since you were five years old.  I would be fun to allow players over their life to kept track of their results against each other.  Sort of for bragging rights.
  
**9. Would love to have other Aussie animals as options for players to choose.  Even countries!**
  - challenge with that would be I need more animated gifs.  I was very lucky with what I found online
  - current use of images could be seen as copyright infringement
  - this could allow for scalability across countries

**10. Would like the game to be informative about Australia animals**

**11. Would be nice to link the page to Aussie wildlife page so people can learn about donating their time or money to assist in the preservation of our indigenous animals.**

**12. Would love to see this game avaliable to play at all Australian souvenior shops :-)**
